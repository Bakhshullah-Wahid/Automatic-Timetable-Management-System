# Timetable-Management-System
final year project
# Description:
Automatic Time Table Management System (ATTMS) is a desktop application that helps us generate timetables automatically and reduces conflict of classes and duplication of the teacher classes at the same time slot, leading to mismanagement. Manual timetable management is time-consuming and conflicting since teachers face multiple problems when they are taking classes in other departments too, like the same time slot with different department classes at the same time. Every department has its timetable when Department 1 needs a teacher from Department 2 the department needs to gather information about the free slot of that teacher which is time-consuming. The automatic timetable management system is brought to reduce this time-consuming.
